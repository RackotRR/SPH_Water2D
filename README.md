# SPH_Water2D
Two-dimensional water simulation with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. 
This code is based on fortran code from "Liu G.R., Liu M.B. - Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics A Meshfree Particle Method 2003" book.

My own implementation of nearest neighbouring particles search - grid find - has complexity O(N) instead of simple direct search algorithm of O(N^2).

Here is interpretation of the SPH program output:
